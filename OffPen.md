### Reconnaissance with `Nmap`

- `-sV`: determine the version of services running
- `-p <PORT_NUMBER>`: port scan
- `-p-`: scans for all ports
- `-p1-200`: scans for ports from 1 to 200
- `-Pn`: disable *host discovery* and scan for open ports
- `-A`: enables OS and version detection, executes in-build scripts for further enumeration

### Locating directories using `Gobuster`

- With `Gobuster`, we will locate a directory to which we can use to upload a shell
- Need a wordlist, can find many under `/usr/share/wordlists` in Kali
- `gobuster dir -u <URL> -w <WORDLIST>`
    - `dir` specifies the mode: directory and file enumeration
    - `-u <URL>` the URL of the target web server
    - `-w <WORDLIST>` specifies the wordlist path
- Other flags
    - `-U` and `-P`: specifies the username and password for authentication
    - `-p <x>`: proxy to use for requests
    - `-c <HTTP_COOKIES>`: specifies a cookie for simulating auth
